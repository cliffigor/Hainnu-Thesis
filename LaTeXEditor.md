# LaTeX Editor

## TeXstudio

[TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) is an integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents. 

## TexMaker

[Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) is a free, modern and cross-platform LaTeX editor for linux, macosx and windows systems that integrates many tools needed to develop documents with LaTeX, in just one application.

Editor's download and installation are uncomplicated. I believe you can install it by yourself.

You can choose either TeXstudio or Texmaker. I prefer TeXstudio personally. TeXstudio is more convenient in multi-file environment and Texmaker is more useful in single-file environment.

Anyway, I choose both. ;-)
